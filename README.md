# Introduction
Data science projects offer you a promising way to kick-start your career in this field. Not only do you get to learn data science by applying it, you also get projects to showcase on your CV! Nowadays, recruiters evaluate a candidate’s potential by his/her work and don’t put a lot of emphasis on certifications. It wouldn’t matter if you just tell them how much you know if you have nothing to show them! That’s where most people struggle and miss out.

You might have worked on several problems before, but if you can’t make it presentable & easy-to-explain, how on earth would someone know what you are capable of? That’s where these projects will help you. Think of the time you’ll spend on these projects like your training sessions. The more time you spend practicing, the better you’ll become!

We’ve made sure to provide you with a taste of a variety of problems from different domains. We believe everyone must learn to smartly work with huge amounts of data, hence large datasets are included. Also, we’ve made sure all the datasets are open and free to access.



Useful Information
To help you decide where to begin, we’ve divided this list into **3 levels**, namely:

Beginner Level: This level comprises of data sets which are fairly easy to work with, and don’t require complex data science techniques. You can solve them using basic regression or classification algorithms. Also, these data sets have enough open tutorials to get you going. In this list, we have also provided tutorials to help you get started.
Intermediate Level: This level comprises of data sets which are more challenging in nature. It consists of mid & large data sets which require some serious pattern recognition skills. Also, feature engineering will make a difference here. There is no limit on the use of ML techniques; everything under the sun can be put to use.
Advanced Level: This level is best suited for people who understand advanced topics like neural networks, deep learning, recommender systems etc. High dimensional datasets are also featured here. Also, this is the time to get creative. See the creativity best data scientists bring into their work and codes.

End Notes
Out of the 24 datasets listed above, you should start by finding the one that matches your skillset. Say, if you are a beginner in machine learning, avoid taking up advanced level data sets from the get go. Don’t bite more than you can chew and don’t feel overwhelmed with how much you still have to do. Instead, focus on making step-wise progress.

Once you complete 2 – 3 projects, showcase them on your resume and your GitHub profile (very important!). Lots of recruiters these days hire candidates by checking their GitHub profiles. Your motive shouldn’t be to do all the projects, but to pick out selected ones based on the problem to be solved, domain and the dataset size. If you want to look at complete project solution, take a look at this article.
